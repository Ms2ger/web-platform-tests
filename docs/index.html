<p>web-platform-tests is a cross-browser testsuite for the
[web platform][web-platform].

<p>If you get stuck or want clarification about anything, feel free to
ask on either the [mailing list][public-test-infra] or [IRC][]
([webclient][web irc], join channel `#testing`); IRC is generally
busiest during the European working day but frequently has people on
it at all times and should probably be the general first port of call
for any help.


## Test Layout

Each top level directory in the repository corresponds to tests for a
single specification, with the exception of `css/` which contains
testsuites for CSS WG specifications. For W3C specs, these directories
are typically named after the shortname of the spec (i.e. the name
used for snapshot publications under `/TR/`); for WHATWG specs, they
are typically named after the subdomain of the spec (i.e. trimming
`.spec.whatwg.org` from the URL); for other specs, something deemed
sensible is used. In any case, there are occasional exceptions for
historic reasons.

Within the specification-specific directory there are two common ways
of laying out tests: the first is a flat structure which is sometimes
adopted for very short specifications; the alternative is a nested
structure with each subdirectory corresponding to the id of a heading
in the specification. The latter provides some implicit metadata about
the part of a specification being tested according to its location in
the filesystem, and is preferred for larger specifications.
